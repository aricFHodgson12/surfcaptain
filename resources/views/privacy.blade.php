        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>The Weather Captain website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.

For example, if you personalize Surf Captain pages, or register with Surf Captain site or services, a cookie helps Surf Captain to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Surf Captain website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Surf Captain features that you customized.</p>
